    Today, I went to internet art class. When I entered,
    I saw two <b>1)</b> <input type="text"> running about. Apparently we were getting
    an in class mesh-net communication program going. Now, I
    could talk to my friends without the <b>2)</b> <input type="text"> finding outðŸ˜‹<br>

    Next, thing I know we are switching gears and the whole
    class is buying flight tickets to <b>3)</b> <input type="text"> to search for dead
    drops. I can't wait to see the <b>4)</b> <input type="text"> there.<br>

    And just when I thought class couldn't get more interesting
    the cops busted in. Apparently the art we created was too <b>5)</b> <input type="text">,
    and apparently illegalðŸ˜± Luckily they loved <b>1)</b> <input type="text"> and let us
    get back to work.
